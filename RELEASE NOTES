03/2009 - Version 0.3 Release Notes

This the beginning of a series of releases for database_form. In this release, we basically sexied it up a little bit and made it compatible with Radiant 0.6.7. New features include:

*Form Response Browser
*Delete Form Response 
*Export to CSV Option
*Download to File Option
*Ability to include/exclude timestamps
*Improved Granularity for Export. It is now possible to select only certain fields to export (such as only emails for mailing list generation)
*Moved testing over to RSpec (www.rspec.info)

Limitations

*The form response browser doesn't do any form of pagination

Future Features

This is what is currently on our agenda. We'd like to see this extension get integrated into a newsletter or other form of contact/mailing list management. If you're interested in getting involved just drop me a line.  

*Ability to send email to an arbitrary number of email addresses when a form is submitted
*Integration of some form of CAPTCHA (most likely reCAPTCHA and a simple equation based CAPTCHA). 
*Ability to clear a form
*Ability to delete a form (or at least delete all the form responses when that DatabaseFormPage is deleted)
*Ability to edit a form response (and bulk edit)
*Ability to import responses into a form (if say one form is broken up into three forms and you want to keep the old data).
